# Project Title
FridgeTracker

# What and Why?

**What:**
FridgeTracker is a mobile application designed to help users efficiently manage their fridge inventory and optimize meal planning. By seamlessly syncing with online grocery services like Amazon Fresh and Instacart, FridgeTracker eliminates the need for manual input, automatically tracking ingredients in both the fridge and pantry. The app provides personalized meal suggestions based on available ingredients and recommends supplementary items to enhance meal variety and reduce food waste.

**Why:**
Food waste is a significant issue in the United States. According to Feeding America, Americans discard 92 billion pounds of food annually—equivalent to 145 billion meals—resulting in over $473 billion in losses. Shockingly, 38% of all food in the country goes to waste. FridgeTracker aims to help users be more resourceful, minimize waste, and maximize efficiency in their kitchens, contributing to a more sustainable future.

# For Whom?
**Primary Users:**
* **Home Cooks:** Who are looking to efficiently manage and use available ingredients and reduce waste.
* **Busy Professionals:** Who want quick and easy meal ideas without last-minute grocery trips 
* **Families:** Who want to effectively to meal plan and save money
* **Students:** Who want to get the most out of their groceries and budget.

# How?
FridgeTracker will offer the following core functionalities:

* **Ingredient Tracking:** Where users can manually input or have their grocery list synced to an online delivery (end goal) allowing the app to automatically update their fridge and pantry inventory.

* **Smart Meal Suggestions:** based on available ingredients, dietary preferences, and cooking time.

* **Shopping list Suggestions:** Suggest additional ingredients to buy to enhance meal possibilities.

* **Expiration Tracking** to notify users of soon-to-expire ingredients and suggest recipes to use them.

# Scope

FridgeTracker is designed to be a semester-long project with a team of 3-5. The core functionality like ingredient tracking, meal planning, and shopping list generation—can be developed incrementally, ensuring a balance between technical challenge and feasibility.

Future enhancements such as AI-based meal recommendations, barcode scanning for quick inventory updates, and integration with grocery delivery services can be considered for expansion beyond the semester timeframe.
